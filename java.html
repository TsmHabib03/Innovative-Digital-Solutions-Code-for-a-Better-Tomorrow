    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, class-based, and object-oriented programming language. Its design prioritizes portability, reliability, and ease of use, making it one of the most widely used languages globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java is compiled into bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing it to execute on any platform that supports JVM without requiring recompilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renowned for its versatility, Java powers everything from web and enterprise applications to mobile apps and embedded systems. Its robust ecosystem and strong security features make it a preferred choice for large-scale systems.

    <p>
      Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems and first released in May 1995. Originally named "Oak" after a tree outside Gosling's office, it was later renamed Java, inspired by coffee, as its developers were avid coffee drinkers. Designed with the motto *"Write Once, Run Anywhere,"* Java quickly became a cornerstone of modern programming.
