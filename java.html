    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, reliability, and ease of use. It runs on any platform supporting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without needing recompilation. Java is widely used in web, enterprise, mobile apps, and embedded systems, with strong security and a robust ecosystem, making it ideal for large-scale systems.
