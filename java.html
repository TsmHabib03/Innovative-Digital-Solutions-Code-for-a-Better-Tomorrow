    <h1>Java:</h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, and object-oriented programming language. Its design prioritizes portability, reliability, and ease of use, making it one of the most widely used languages globally. Java is compiled into bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing it to execute on any platform that supports JVM without requiring recompilation.</p>

    <p>Java is renowned for its versatility, powering everything from web and enterprise applications to mobile apps and embedded systems. Its robust ecosystem and strong security features make it a preferred choice for large-scale systems.</p>

    <img class="photo1" src="James Gosling.jpeg">
    <p>Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems and first released in May 1995. Originally named "Oak" after a tree outside Gosling's office, it was later renamed Java, inspired by coffee, as its developers were avid coffee drinkers. Designed with the motto "Write Once, Run Anywhere," Java quickly became a cornerstone of modern programming.</p>
